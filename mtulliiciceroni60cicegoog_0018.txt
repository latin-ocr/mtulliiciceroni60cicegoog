DESIGN AND EXEOUTION OF THE DIALOGUE. Xl

mankind from the yoke ol superstition. If Lucretius describes the
state oi the world, unenlightened by Epicurus, in the words lrurrraaa
arete occas sarde mum uita jaceret iu terris oppressa qraui cub religiose,
qrrae caput a caeli regionibus osterulelat louilda' super aspectu uror·
talibus ualuas (1 63 foll), and again faciunt arsisses buarius formidine
diram depressosque premeret ad terram (vr 52), we find (licere (Diu.
11 148)dep10ring the evil in almost the same terma, aaut, ut uere
loqueram superstitio susa per pentes oppressit emulum sere arsimus
atque lominum imbecillitatem occupavit ...... Iactat enim et urqet et quc

plurimae curae rectusque rrascurttur¹. If Lucretius speaks of the
everlasting punishments of Tartarus as the climax of those terrers
which kept men all their lifetime ‘subject to bondage', Cicero makes
his Stoic repudiate this es a superstition which was at length felt
even hythe vulgar ιο ιι no longer endurable¹. It is true that

petrsted in the name os religion, as Lucretius speaks os the sacrifice ol
Iphigenia: he is content here to show the iolly and misery of super-
stition, and the inequity ol the principles ci action which it ascribes
ιο ιιι gods 3 but elsewhere he contrasts it with religion, as a spurious

is unneoessary ιο say more ol this translation than that it loses the force ol

where he touches on other points which concern our present trectise. 'l'he

exactly the reverse ol the truth‚ as may be seen lrom the passages cited iu p. xxi
ol my hnd volume and ιιι notes on 11 162, 163, 11193, 95; and Posidonius was
not a Peripatetiu (asie stated in vol. 11 389) but one ol the most famous ol the
younger Stoice.
