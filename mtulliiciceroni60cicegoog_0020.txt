established in the time of Polybius, who however does not altogether
condemn the latter in V1 56), cerum ctiam nrojcrss nostri superati·
tiorum a religione separaosmnt ,· while at the same time the lact that
he thinks it necessary to claim the authority of ancient usage lor his
own distinction, may perhaps be regarded as an indication that it was
not yet fully recognized. It was apparently unknown to the author
of the treatiss ad Herennium, who couples religio with ambare and
other pensione which impel to evil (11 34); but it seems to have been
ohserved ογ all later writers. Thus, while Lucretius always uses religio
in a bad sense and never uses mrperstdio at all, his imitator Virgil
reserves religio for what is laudablc and speaks of rana superstitio sete-
rumqae ι’γιιιννο deomm (Aen. vm 187), and so Horace reckons tristis
superstitio among the diseases ol the mind (Sat. 113. 79). Perhaps
it may he thought that the difference between (liceto and Lucretius
is not a difference of meaning as to the word religio, bnt a differencs
of feeling and judgment as regards the facts denoted by the word.
Such a view would be quite consistent with the supposition that
Cicero's dialogus is intended in part as a protest against the doctrine
advocated hy Lucretius; but Lucretius himself asserta more than
once that his doctrine is not hostile to religion, as Cicero would under-
stand that word¹. In either case it seems to me clear that, while
agrseing with Lucretius as to the evils wrought in the name of religion,
Cicero wished to make it plain to all mon that these evils did not
tlow from religion rightly understood, but from its corruption, which
he distinguished by the name of superstitio,· and that an indiscrimi-
nate attack on all that went under the name ol religion was sven
more injurious to society than superstition itseli.

Assuming then that Cicero had this double practical aim in
writing his treatise, first to eradicate superstition, second, to show
the importance of a rational religion3 and that hs combines with
this the speculative aim of completing his system and expounding to
his countrymsn the theological news of the leading Greek philo·
sophers, we have next to consider how this design has been carried
