DESIGN AND EXECUTION OF THE DIALOGUE. xlx

there is no external power to check the progress of the whole ; there·
fore tho universe as a whole must attain perfection.

The larger portion of the 2nd book is occupied with the subject
of Providonce. Thisisargued lst hom our idea ol the Divine nature
as active and benevolent‚ and 2nd from the skill manifested in
the universe, which attests the wisdom of the great Αιιίει, just in
the same way as the orrery attests the wisdom of Archimedes The
skill of the Creator is then shown in detail, Istas regards the earth
and the heavenly bodies, 2nu as regards the adaptatione visible in
vegetable and animal life, aad and above all in the case of man. It
is further shown that the universe existe sor the sake of its rational
inhabitants, and that all things tend to the good oi man, that pro·
videntia] care extende even to individual men, that virtue and wisdom
are divine gista, that the philosopher isdear ιο God and can never
experience what is really harmsul.

So far Ι think we may be sure that Cicero would go along with
Balbus. It is no more than he has repeatedly said in his own
person elsewhere, except as ιο the Scale of Existence, ιο which we
find resemblances, it is true, but no exact parallel in the passages
quoted in my notes. There are other parts of his discourse which
are less in harmony with what we know of Cicero's opinions from
other treatisee Such are the identification of heat with intelligence‚
the ascription of life, thought and volition ιο the material universe
and the hravenly bodies, the sanction accorded hythe Stoice ιο the
popular mythology as representing either the varied activity of the
Suprema Being, the personification of abstract qualities, or the
divinity of the human soul 3 ιο which we may add the belief in
divination ¹.

When we go on ιο inquire into the arrangement os the 2nd book,
there is much to find fault with. The main divisione are by no means
clear. As is pointed out in Vol. '11 p. xxii, much that is placed under

¹ Cicero, speaking in his own person, asserta the existence and tho immateri-
slity ol God, and ascribes to him the origin cl all motion and the iatherhood ol
