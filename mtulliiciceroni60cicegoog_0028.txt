was prompted by policy, not by religi0n3 to suppose otherwise would
be to imputa injustice to the Gods (ἓξ 11-15). This sets auide 011
of the grounds assigned for the prevalence of religious belief by
0111121111, his 2nd ground, that of the terrible phenomena 01 nature,
isallowed as a fact; the two others are defer-red along with the
arguments 01 Zeno aud Chrysippus to the 3rd head. The 2nd brooch
of the discussion deals with the Divina nature. This begins in f 20
witha (111111021111111101 to the corresponding part 01 the argument
01 Balbus (11 45). In both the questionis 000111 eorum notura sit,-
both refer to the stupefying influeuce of custom Cotta then proceeds
to challenge Balbus’ assertion mundum animumne csse ot deum, and
the proof alleged for it nihil muodo essa melius. ‘It no more follows
from this,’ he says, ‘that 2111 world must be possessed of reason than
that 2111 city 01 Rome is a reasoning creaturam· that, 11 12 is 102,
12 must be reckoued 01 lesa velue than the ant which is possessed of
reason! (11.1 45, 16.) Β12 the same proof had been quoted aa
from Zeno in 11 2l, so Cotta recurs to that (111 22),111 spite of his
avowedintention 01 leaving it for the section on Providence, aud
raphes thatun the same principle we might argue that the world
could read a book. In §23 he deals with another argument of Zeno's
given in 11 22, puttiug it in a more general form (apparently witha
reference to the Socratic argument in 11 18) ‘everything which exista
ia derived from the world, aud the world 011 produce nothing unlilre
itself, therefore 2111 human reason is a product of 2111 world and
resembles it.' ‘On the same principle,' he says, ‘we might maintain
that the world could play the fluta' The next argument touched on
by (lottais that which deduces the divinity 01 2111 stara from their
regular motione, apparently referring to 11 54 foll. ‘Similarly we
might argue for the divinity 01 quartan fevers' (111 24). For an
examination of these objections see nn. on tha particular passages
In §25 Cotta goes back 20 Chrysippus (1116, 17). His 112 argument
is that ‘if there is anything in 2111 world beyond man’s power to
make, he who made it must be God’3 the 2nd that ‘if there wera no
Gods, man would be 2111 beat thing in the universe, which it would
be the extreme 01 arrogance 20 suppose' 3 the ard that ‘the world is
too beautiful to have been built simply for the habitation of man’
Ootta'a answer to the 112 is that it ignores the distinction between
nature aud raason (which 01 001111 has no force against the Stoica
who identified nature with reason, and does not in the least dagroe
effect the inference that there is a superhuman power at work in 2111
