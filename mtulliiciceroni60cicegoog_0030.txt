in the popular theology‚ which they talre under their protection‚ and
that it is impossible ιο say what is believed about each deity. It is
here that (liceto inflicta upon us the tedious mythological section, of
which Sextus was satisfied ιο give one or two extracta as specimens
I have spoken sufficiently of this in the Essay on the Sources and in
the Appendix.

After this, many chapters are lost till we come to the answer to
the Stoic proof oi Divina beneficence as shown in the gift of reason
In the speech of Balbus this was treated under the general head oi
Providence (11 147, 148), hera it is treated as a part oi the argument

ιο prove a special providential care forman (ιιι 66-78). Cotta
shows by examples taken from the stage and the law-courts the ill

effecta of reason, and argues that, it it is a divine gift, the Giver is
responsible for effecte, which he must have foreseen, and against which
he ought to have secured man. There is a disertangement in these
paragraphs which was perhaps caused by the mistalren insertion of
two alternative versione or abstracta of the Greek original. It isa
deiect in Cicero's exposition oi the Stoic argument in the previous
bools that the difficulties urged by the Academic under this last head
are not touched on by Balbus. In all probability they formed part oi
the csrgo thrown overboard by Cicero (inffl 164-167) in order to
save his Aratea. Other arguments alleged against a providential
ordering of human affairs are the universal lack of wisdom deplored
by the Stoica, and the unrighteous distribution of prosperity and
adversity. The Stoice have depreciated the importance of these
gifte of fortune in comparison with the qualities of the soul, but
Providence has nothing to do with the latter ; each man must achieve
them for himself. Besides, whether important or unimportant,
nothing should bo neglectcd under the rule os Providence. It hae
been attempted to eke out the case ior providential government by
pointing to the missortunes which beiall the descendants of the guilty,
but what sort of justice is thisl Is it even consistent with the Stoic
idaeos God, that he should exact punishment at allt The Stoica
themselves allow that his care does not extend to individuale,
what reason have wo for supposing that it extends ιο mankindl
(11179-93).

Spealsing generally the Academic objections under this head
are well and clearly stated by Cicero, but here and there ob
scurities arise from too great conciseness‚ see note on §91 (Ι) c. 9),
