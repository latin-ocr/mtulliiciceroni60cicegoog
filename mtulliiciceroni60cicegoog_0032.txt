01 every letter 01 the creed, forbids all thought as to its meaning under

11Αὸ THE NATURA DEORUM PUBLISHED DURING THE
ulau-Tine OF CICERO?

In 1110 preceding essay indicatione 01 hasty composition have been
pointed 001, and it hasbeen remarhed 11101 00100 passages 'present 1110
appearance 01 having been made up 01 two 0110100111010101011001
the same original, both 01 which have been inserted by 1111010110. If
this 10 00, 11 would seem that the book must have been published
without 1110 author's revision. Are there any 10010 which would
confirm this suspicioni

The conclusive proof that the hook did not receive the finishing
touches 11001 the hand 01 110 author, is to be found in the inconsistent
allusions 10 the time occupied in the discussion Thus, in 11 73 110
find 1110 conversation 01 the 101 boolr alludcd to in the words 0 te ipso
1101111110 die dictam cst, and in 111 18 the 21111 110011 10 01100011 10 in
the words 01111110 qaae 0 te 1111111110 tertius 111010 011111, 11001 which 110
should 111101 that the whole discussion must have occupied four days,
giving one day to each speech. But ii we look back to the beginning
011110 2111101111 3111 books (qaae cam Cotta dixisset tum Velleius 11 1,
qaae cam Balbus dixisset tam arrideas 00110 111 1), we find no hint
01 any break in the conversation. The only reference to time is in
111 9100001010 advesperascit dabis 110110 diem aliquem 111 000110 ista
dicamus, which certainly implies 11101 the conversation had occupied
only one day. There is no difficulty 01 this kind in other dialogues
In 1110 Tusculana (1 8) Cicero distinctly says 1110111111 quiaque scholas
111 totidem libros 10111011, and there is a formal notice 01 the close 01
one day and the beginning 01 another in 1 119, 11 9, 10, 1167, 1117,
111 84, 1v ’1, v 1, 11, with a separato dedication 01 preface to each
book. In the De Finibus the first two books arc supposed to be
spoken continuously 01 Cicero's villa at 001000, the 3111 0011411100
a different occasion at Lucullus' Tusculan 11110, the 5111111 Plato’s
Academia at Athens.
