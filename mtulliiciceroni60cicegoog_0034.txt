RELATIONSHIP OF MSS.

ΟΝ THE RELATIONS OF ORELLI'S MSS TO THE
ARCHETYPE AND TO EAOH OTHER.

The archetype from which all the existing uss are derived must
have been in a very bad condition, having lost considerable portione
of the 3rd book, and having suffered much from dislocation in the
end book and, as Ι believe, in the 3rd also. Of the four sections,
into which the 3rd book is divided, the whole of Ο (dealing with the
Stoic argument in proof of the Providential Government of the

universe) and a considerable portion of D (dealing with the argu·
ment in proof of a special Providenoa ordering the affairs of men)

have been lost ; and smaller losses occur in the same hook at the end
of ἐξ 13 and 64, and in 1 ἓ 25, 65. The great instance of dislocation
isin the end book, where ᾖξ’ 16-86 are placed after 5 156, but in
my note on 11143 at jam doceto, Ι have attempted to show
that we have there also a transposition in the nse ciffi 53-60,
which ought to come before ἓ 43. For examples of what appears to
me dislocation on a smaller scale, see the notes on 1 6 quc quidem in
cama, 1 97 an quicquam—vidimus (which, following Bake, Ι have
transferred to the end of ξ 88), 11 110 atque ita dimatant-appareat,
transferred ως 104, also 11167 magnis copiis,11129 eumque omne
animal, ἕ 34 etenim, 5 7011. on Da (3) The cause of the dislocation
in Bk. 11 was donbtless that the archetype had come to pisces and
was bound up again in wrong order, without any regard to sense.
So B (cod. Leid. 86) interposes part of the De Disinatione after
N. D. 1 64, giving the following ἕ (tr-91) after De Fato ἓ 4, see
note on the latter passage in Orelli’s ed, and Bake’s ed. of the De
lepidus p. 104 foll, where B is thus described “coirstat quaterni·
onibus mv. quornm singulo octo solio baberet. Ceterum descriptus
aeae viderur e libro crtjies pantomimae misere digesti essent ,· locis
quippe plurimis, continuata scriptura, alienissima interponuntur,
omniumque ordo et series turbantur, qnae tamen ne legenti fraudem
faciant, onis nunus in margine subinde solet indicare.’' In Bk. 111
I have suggested that it may have bean Cicero's own intention to
omit the mythologioal scotica, and that this was afterwards inserted
by the original editor in a wrong place. As to the smaller transposi-
tions they are probably owing to the wrong insertion of marginal notes
or of additions written on slips oi parchment which got fastened tothe
