carelees but capricious und for the most part quite indifferent to
making sense. The first two Ι regardas honest but somewhat incom-
petent witnesses, the writer ol P has no intention to deceive, but his
inaccurac'y almost amounts to dishonesty, while the writer of B, a
far more competent witness, as far as ability goes, is not satisfied
merely to report, but deliberately sets himself to improve the read·
ings cf the archetype Itis perhaps unnecessary ior me to adduce
any evidence of the carelessness of APV, as that will be apparent to
any one who will glauce over the readings os a chapter or two in
Orelli's edition, but I shall endeavour to show (1) that A and V are
independent oi each other, but approach more nearly to one another
than to any of the other uss, (2) that B is connected with the arche· ,
type by a different line of descent from the others, and has frequently
preserved the true reading which has been lost by them, but that it
also nitere the mistaken readings ol the archetype so as tc make
sense The varying disarrangements in BPV seem to show that
these are mutually independent and are not copied either from A or
from the immediate ancestor ol A ; and this conclusion is confirmed
by the subjoined comparison ol particular readings. Ihave compared
the readings for the 3rd book, as the uss are less imperfectior
this than for the earlier books. I give first those readings in which
the unaltered A and V agree against ΒΟ aud P, taking no account
os Orelli’s 6th codex E, belonging to the 15th century. In making
this comparison it must be remembered that it is only cf APV
that we have the complete readings in Orelli's edition Where the
true reading is not that ol AV it is given first in round brackets.
