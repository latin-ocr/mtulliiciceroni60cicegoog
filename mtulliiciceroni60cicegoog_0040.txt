annimousms or uss. xxxiii ,

5 20. a eouuutudiue euim, where euim is omitted by the other
uss and given in contraction hy V. In this case there can be little
doubt that V represents the' archetype.

ἕ 35. quem ipsum uou omrws interpretantur uuo niodo, qui
quoniam quid diceret intelleqi uoluit, ornittamus, where the other uss
omit qui and even V seems uncertain. Baiter thinks aou omues-modo ·
to be a gloss, which would naturally suggest a connecting qui before
quoniam: on the other hand qui would easily be lost before
quoniam. v ·

ἕ 62. talis a philosophia pellatur error, where the final a of
philosophia (which probaby commenoed a new line in the archetype)
is written separately in V¹. From this the readings oi the other
uss would easily spring, via t. a philosophiappelhrtur error A,
t. a philosophi 'cappellatur e. 13¹0, t. philosophia appellatur e. B'
(evidently altered to make sense), and sot. a philosophis appellatur
e. PE and V¹ (only that the last has apellatur).

§70- quisquamne istuc ueqat by corr. in V, where A has quic
quam iuste (iusta being ‘in raa’ by a late hand), 0 quisquam istae,
BP quisquae istuc (quas cancelled in Β), quid istra E. I am inclined
to think the archetype had quisquc stuc (for exx. oi stuc in Cicero's
uss see my n. and Lachmann’s Lucr. p. 197), so that here the
unaltered B and P are its best representatives.

§ 73. usqua ut iuda auferam (seo n ia loc.) which, written
continuonsly in the archetype, is nearly the sams as V¹ aeque liudo
auferam ,· the other readings are easily explicable from V, viz. qu‘uea
uude aus. AOEP, and ue quidinde aus. B, which may be compared
with the superscription of qaid over euque in V’.

584. pecunia edixisse V, where B¹ has perseniae dixisse, and
AB'OP mcuuia cliniae Here it would seem that B must be either
taken directly from a us in which the words were not separated, or
(aa I think more probable), from a ns wrongly copied from snoh an
archetype.

Το these some would add ἓ 66, where V has pernrioism see ia loa

Trua teat presuued by Α atoue.

5 67. manuam (so Baiter), others postquam.

§⁶3- quam clam Thyestem, see nn. Plias quam ahauthpastem,
(land by corr. B have quadam thpestem, V quem (ἰαπι hpastem,
(corr. fr. hyastim), E quam daut thiestem. Hera thera can be no
