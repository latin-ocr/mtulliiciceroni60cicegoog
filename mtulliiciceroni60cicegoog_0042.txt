RELATIONSHIP OF MSS. XXXV

must either represent the archetype, emended by V' and B, or else
the former are derived from the same incorrect copy 01 α.

(10011 1101 non is what Cicero wrote, but the reading nonne is not so
objectionablo as 10 call foremendation. It would seem therefore
that B here represents the archetypo, and that the others are con-
nected with it by a medium which in this instance proves to be less
trustworthy.

526. Orionem B, orationem ACEPV. Here in all probability α
had a contractiori wrongly interpreted by all but B*.

527. 0100110 [Β], 00100110 ACEPV. This is another evidence
showing that Β 10 connected with the archetype by a different line of
descent from that of the others.

543. ,(001001000011111), cap. 110 Β, orn. 110 AOEPV. The
demonstrative seems necessary, but was 01 course easily lost after -lia

547. 1110 B, 111 AEV¹, 111 O, 1100 V’, nothing said 01 P. Here
C appears 10 represent a, while AV have neglected to mark the
abbreviated 0 and Β has written it out in 1011. -

omitted tha demonstrative, as in ἕ 43 01 0110001, where I have added
1011. 11 Cicero wrote 0111 di sunt, it would be easy for 11 10 drop
out, and the variety 01 readings suggests that each scribe reinserted
it, where he thought best.

§52 jam B, tam OEV, and probably A¹, tam A', nothing said
01 P. Here Β either follows aseparate tradition or has emended the
common archetype.

easily be mistalsen for 00000 and v.v. Τ10 readings may be most
easily explained by supposing two recensione 01 α, 000 followed by

AOPV (β), 110 01100 by B (y).
