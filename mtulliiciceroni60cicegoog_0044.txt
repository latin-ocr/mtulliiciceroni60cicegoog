ᾖ 54. Pierias 0, pieriae ABE, proelias P, pierides V. Here it
would seem that α must have had pierias, variously corrupted in PV3
O ia an easy emendation.

565. communiae di radus iunianis O, for di the other uss have de,
which is a very natural corruption of original di, and was probably
the reading ol a, corrected by Ο.

ἓ 72. quod sumas, quauta damper literatius ΟΕ ; lor dissipes
ABPV¹ have dissipia, V' dunipas. Here too I think it is easiest to
regard O's reading as a correction ol dissipis.

ξ 74. defide maia tutele (for dae) 0, defidefidem aiatat utile A,
da fide adulat-atalae B, dc fide mala ut utile PV, da fide maia
tot utiles F. Here A must have arisen lrom a wrong division ol
words (defidam alat uteie) and a double dittographia effide and at:
perhaps in α 666 line ended with at. Ithink it probable that bere too
O’s reading is an emendation, as B's certainly is

§Sd qraue Ο, qrauem all others. Probably amiculum was mis·
taken lor 666 diminutive ol amicus and so made masculine. O’s read-
ing Itakc to be an emendation.

586. cuipiam mocvuit Ο, quipiam a. A¹B, quippiam n. A'V
(nonng said or a ane P). Here 1 tuni ne original rtanng was
probably qsaoipiam, corrupted to quipiam in a, and variously emended
by V and G.

594. in earn OE, ineram (with r erased) A, in eram BP¹V¹, in
iatam 1²¹, iu mnam V'. Here a must have bad uam, OE are no
doubt corrected after ‘A

Traia tant preserved by P alana

5 26. conformatum [P], confirmatum others.

566. istuc istac ibit PE (perhaps B¹), istuc is tacebit (l, istuc
iata ibit AVB', iatlaaca marg. V same hand. Thero can 66 no doubt
that Phora represents a, and that 666 form istac being not very
common, got corrupted in ABV3 the marginal reading ol Vis pra

bably an attempt to explain istac.
ἓ 92. barac PV', hacc others.

Igo on to give soma crucial instances illnstrating tha character
ol 666 different nas.

ἓ 13. da Sagra. All the uss have gone wrong here, AOEPV
having sacra by inadvertence‚ but B changes this into sacris to suit

666 context.
