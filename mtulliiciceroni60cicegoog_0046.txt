546. saraam cst BPV', sarrae eat on¹ (in Aa erased), sannas
Ε. Probably α had ferrat st, corrected in BP.

ἓ 47. lueres AEVB', lucos P making it the object of interpretor,
lacis B¹ perhaps to suit Athenis, locus O.

551. Arqat' A¹PV¹‚ arcui B, arcas A¹V¹, arci OE. Arqui is
plainly the reading of a, ol which the others are corruptions.

5 56. Argum dicitur interemisse [A’BOE], argentam d t'. A¹P V.

Probably α had an abbreviation, misread by the first recension (β),
bot rightly interpreted by B and emended by C.

Aegyptum prry‘uqisae [OE]‚ aeyyptum profuisse AB¹V¹,
aeqypto praefuisse B'PV'. Ithinh a must have agreed with ABV,
and that (1 and P are emendations.

ἕ 64. dicamus indique natzar-27³ Madv, oouj.‚ diceliuaa igneis
AOPV, dic elio ctare igneis V’, dicamus dignata de dyc E„ dicamas
digno dis B. As m, a, a and li are frequent-ly interchanged in thc
uss, there is no difficulty about the first word, but how are wc to
explain the change from indigua rectoris into a igneis? The last
syllable is an abbreviation for narraris, so the problem is how to
change indignatoris into a ἱθηαίε. The disappcarance of the repeated
na explains itself and we are left with a followed by hiatus to repre·
sent iad. If this is a correct account of the readings in AOPV it is
plain that B and E are merely conjectural.

per mare BPV and (with re on erasure of four letters) A,
permanere OE and probably ΑΚ

ἓ 65 fin. ai ob rem (see my n), ai orbem V, niobem ΑΟἜ, aiche
B ς ia jovem 0¹, aa iobcm P, om. cdd. with some inferior uss. No
one has attempted to offer any explanation ol the oldest readings3 it
has been assumed that Niobe in B was a gloss giving the name os the
speaker, but why in the world should Niobe have beon selectedl
If πὶ obrem were the reading of a, this would naturally be changed
into the more familiar ai orbem or rl'iobem, and B would naturally try
to make sense by dropping the nr.

ἕ 69. pestifera est malleis admodum- parteis saltatoria. Instead oi
est A¹BEPV¹ have sint, OA²V² sit, in place of the original st,· B
retaining the plural mends the grammar by reading saltatorie.

ᾗ 70. nocere Deianira volarit AOEPV, a.. Dianae ira coluit B by
an ingenious emendation.

572. attornet BPA²V²‚ aerari et A¹V¹OR Ishould suppose
that B represents a, misread by β and corrected by P.

ἓ 74. haec cotidiana, sicce, verano AOEPV, t. c. sica v. B
(Atering the number to make it agree with cotidiana).
