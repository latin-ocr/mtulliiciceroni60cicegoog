tenulorem? OF MSS.

Thia agrees fairly with Forchhammer’s view (Nordiak Tidalm‘st
for 1880, p. 23 foll), except that ha does not recognize any connexion
between E and the lat line oi descent (β), whereas many instances
will be found above in which E agrees with A and O against B.
I think also he is wrong in speaking of the group (y) as a familia
deterior. Almoet all the inferior codices may Ι think be affiliated
ιο P. Again, where B alone has the true reading, Forchhammer will
not allow that thiais due to its being itself copied from the arche·
type or even to its belonging to a better tradition: iu all such
cases he holda that the true reading is an emendation. Ido not
think any one who has taken the trouble ιο look through the
readings given above will accept this view of B. On the other haud
I cannot agree with Mttller (Neue Jahrbttclaev 1864 pp. let-147,
rel-281, tot-631) and Vahlen (in the introduction to his edition
of the Da lapidata) in ranking B higher than All, Itis undoubtedly
less trustworthy‚ and though it is more often the sole represen-
tative of the archetype, this may be only because, A being closely
alliud with OPV, where A is right, these are usually right with it

It may be worth while to add that the texts used by Priscian

and Probus seem to have been in some respecta better than our
archetype, cf. 11 117, 118 aud 91 for Prob. 106, for Priscian
