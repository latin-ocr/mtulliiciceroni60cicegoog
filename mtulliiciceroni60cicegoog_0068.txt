'lhat Carneades was the great source of all criticism of Stoic

doctrines and especially of Stoic theology is evident from Cicero's
own words N.D. 11 162 Carneadea libenter ia Stoicos invehebatur,
Tuae. v 83 contra Stoicos, quoe studiosissime seraper refellebat et
eoutra quorum disciplinam iapeuium drea exarserat, N. D. 1 4 areat
aute-m alie· pbibraophi qui deorum arente breuem maroilum admini-

citaret leonciaee uon socordes ed ucri iuvestipuudi cupiditatem. We
might therefore assume a priori that the argument of the Third
Book was taken from him, even if it were not distinetly stated
in regard to the proof that no animal ean be eterna] (111 29),
and in regard to the sorites showing the impossibility of drawing
any line between the divine aad human iu the traditional my·
thology (111 44). The same thing appears from the eth book of
Sextus Empirieus Arte. ulau. where we meet with many of the
arguments used by Cicero. Thus, at the commencement of the
discussion on natural causes, Sext-us declares his intention net to
dwell too much on points of detail or run to the immoderate
length of Clitomachus in resuting the dogmatista, but to sum up
the most important arguments on both sides and allow them to
balance one another (Η 1). As the whole discussion is of inte·
rest for this as well as for the earlier books of our treatise, it may
be worth while to give a short analysis, referring to the parallel
passages in the N. D. The positive argumentis probably taken
in part at least from Posidonius, see Introduction on the Sourees
of the First Book, vol. 1 p. lii foll, and Sehweneke Jahrb. s cl.
Philol. 1879, lp. 57 foll.

The discussion in Sextus rna-ybe divided as follows: (A) The
origines religione belief, (l) positive argument ἢ 13-28, (2) negative
argument §3 29-47. (B) The fact of the divine existence, (l)
positive argument& 48-136, (2) negative argument& lte-194. Ι
give them in order below.

(Α) The origin of religion has been ascribed to the earliest legislators
who desired to establish a chock upon unrighteousness of thought as well
as of dead §b 14-16 (N. D. 1 118). Euhenrerus thought that the first rulers
of mankind deelared themselves divine iu order to increase their own power

to life, as the Suu, the rivers t la (X. D. 1 lle); Democritus that images uf
