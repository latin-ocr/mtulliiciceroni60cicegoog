graph It 11 strange that, after announcing 1111 intention 11 postponing
1111 arguments 01 Cleanthes, Chrysippus and Zeno to 1111 311 head 11
his discussion, (111111111ιῆΊ 20, 21 merely commences his reply 101111
211 head (11 45, 46) and then falls back on the arguments of Zeno
1111 Chrysippus, dealing with the 11111 point Schwencke proposes
an ingenious explanation 11 Cicero’s change of plan. He thinks 11111
the title 11 Clitomachus’ treatise was περὶ προνοίας; 111 that, when
Cicero, feeling himself unable 10 carry out his original intention 11
answering each argument 11 Posidonius in its proper order, spoke of
deferring certain arguments 11 the section on Providence, his real
meaning was to set aside altogether the Posidonian order and follow
that of Clitomachus instead. Furthcr he supposes Clitomachus to
have commenced his treatise with 1 preliminary argument on the
divine existence, just as Posidonius commences his own defence of
the belief in Providcncc (11 75) by showing 11111111111011111111111111)1
from our conception 11 God. Hence it might well include 1111
Carneadean argument 1111111 mortality ef 111 animal nature (111 29-
31) as well 111111 1111111111 01 the above-mentioned arguments of
Zeno and Chrysippus. There ean be little doubt that Cicero has
horrowed the 1111111111111 these in ἓξ 21--26 from his Greek original 3
the argument in ᾗ 23 11, 11 we hare seen, cited by Sextus as 11011
Α11111111. It may be asked why the argument 11 the Xenophontio
Socrates 11 discussed out 11 chronological order in ᾖ 27, 28, though
it 1111 111 mentioned along with the others in 5 18. But so it is 1110
11 11 18. 11 both it 111111 11 as an appendage to the argument 110111
Chrysippus: it is probable therefore that it was cited by Chrysippus
and criticized as a part 01 his argument by Clitomachus. Schwencke
finds a confirmation 01 1111 surmise 1110 the 11111 ofClitomachus'
work in 111 65, where Cicer0, attha 111111111111111111111111111111011

aereadum pulo. 81 far I am disposed to agree with him, but Ι 111 no
reason for doubting the Carneadean origin of g 39-65 because of
1111111111 allusione 111111 1011111 hook. It is not pretended 11111 any
of the topics treated 11 111 1111111111 11 Carneades, and however
careless Cicero may have been, he was surely capable 11 remembering
whether the same topic had been touched on in the previous book,
and, 1111, 11 adding 111111 verisimilitude of the dialogus by making
a reference to it. Nor can I agree with Schwencke when he says that
it would be 1111111111 11 assume the pure Cameadean origin 11 any
portion whiehis not supported bya parallel in 81111111. Sextus being
