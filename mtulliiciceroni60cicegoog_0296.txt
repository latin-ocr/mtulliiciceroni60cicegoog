narrated by Mnaseas in the ard book of his Europa. Harpocration
cites Mnaseas for the statement that Minerva, daughter of Coryphe,
daughter of Oceanus, was the inventress of chariots. Tzetzes and
Firmicus agree in the story of Minerva slaying her father Pallas
The Orpbio hymns illustrate the names Eubuleus, Tritopatreus,
Anactes. Aa Mnaseas is mentioned by three different writers,
Arnobius, Harpocration and Fulgentius, as the source from whom
they have horrowed, sud as he is a noted Euhemerist of the
Alexandrian school, the evidence, so far as it goes, seems to point
to him as the mythologist followed by Clitomachus, ie. by Carneades.

As regards Cicero's summary, it is evidently very incompleta.
He omits from his list the names J uno, Ceres, Neptunus, Mars,
Pluto, Hecate, Pan, Rhea, Proserpina. He sometimes pasees over
the common tradition, as that which makes Dionysus son of Semele:
he omits to note real differentes, such as that between his three
Cupids and the primaeval Eros, orÂ¹ between the Greek and the
Ephesian Diana, aud makes distinctions where there amnone, as
in the ease of Aesculapius, Mercurius and Minerva The frequent
references to Egypt, the paternity of Nilus in the case of five
deitiee, the names Tbeuth and Phthas and the ineffable name of
Mercurius would seem to indicate an Alexandrino origin, while
the references to mystic rites suggest a connexion with the Orphic
theology.

In the comparative view, which follows, square brackets denote
that the statement made is not given in that particular place by
Cicero, but supplied from another part of his summary.
